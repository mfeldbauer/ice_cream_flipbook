# Ice Cream Flip Book project

## What is this project?
I created a flip book using html/javascript to keep track of all of the ice cream shops my friend and I have visited together. We really love ice cream. I followed the tutorial here to create the flip book: [Video](https://youtu.be/0kD6ff2J3BQ) | [GitHub](https://github.com/codingstar-jason/3D-Flip-Book-Tutorial-Customized-CodingStar)

The ice cream cone image from the front cover was taken from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/Nag3E3yzygU). All of the store/brand logos were found by searching for "brand name logo" and were likely from their website. The QR code on the front cover links to a google map of all of the stores.
